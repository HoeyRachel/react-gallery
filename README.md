# Project Name

Weekend Gallery

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a mini portrait gallery of my life. Base functions of the project needed to include:
* Getting Images from the Server onto the DOM
* Clicking on an Image should bring up the description. 
* There should be a like button and the number of likes should stay on the screen.

It took me about 11 hours to get base mode completed.
